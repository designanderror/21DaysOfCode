# 21DaysOfCode
 
Charles Duhigg has explained elaborately in his book “Power of Habit” that any good or bad habit is only solidified when you practice it for 21 days; be it the habit of exercising, eating well, or reading a book. It can be a part of your daily life if you repeat it religiously for 21 consecutive days.  

By using this amazing physiological concept I in collaboration with Lapsus Next (https://www.lapsusnext.com ) came up with Special 21- A series full of Fun and exiting animations using JS, HTML and CSS.  

Feel free to use it and it would be grate if credits are given.
